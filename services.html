      <p>This isn't a sales pitch. It's a working session where the clarity process begins.</p>

      <p>Before our call, I'll share access to the <strong>Daily Rhythm Mapper</strong>—a Notion-based tool I created to help you reflect on your patterns, priorities, and friction points throughout your day.</p>

      <h3>During our 20-minute call, we'll:</h3>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Review Step 1 of your Daily Rhythm Mapper together</li>
        <li>Discuss what you want more of this season—and what habits you're ready to leave behind</li>
        <li>Begin brainstorming supportive rituals and phone-based changes that could help</li>
        <li>Identify whether the full Ritual Reset feels like the right next step</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You'll leave with initial clarity and direction—not a sales pitch. The work has already begun.</p>

  <!-- How We Work Together Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="container content-section">
      <h2>How we make your phone work for YOU</h2>
      <p>This is one part mindset work, two parts meaningful tech tweaks. The process unfolds across both stages:</p>

      <div class="process-steps">
        <div class="process-step">
          <span class="progress-marker">Begins in your free call</span>
          <h3>1. Clarify your current priority</h3>
          <p>We'll begin identifying what matters most to you right now and use that focus to shape your ritual. Your priority might be:</p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Physical wellness</li>
            <li>Mental and emotional balance</li>
            <li>Productivity and focus</li>
            <li>Financial grounding</li>
            <li>Reflection and spiritual practice</li>
            <li>Relationships and connection</li>
            <li>Creativity and joy</li>
            <li>Home environment or travel rhythms</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <span class="progress-marker">Deepens in the Ritual Reset</span>
          <h3>2. Co-design your custom wellness ritual</h3>
          <p>Together we'll shape a habit or routine that fits your real life and moves you forward. This might look like:</p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>No-scroll morning grounding to start your day without spiraling</li>
            <li>Nervous-system-supportive wind-down that actually helps you rest</li>
            <li>Weekly check-ins for groceries, finances, or planning</li>
            <li>Protected creative blocks for writing, art, or flow work</li>
            <li>Gentle movement nudges that fit your actual energy</li>
            <li>Meal and hydration anchors so essentials don't get skipped</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <span class="progress-marker">Implemented in the Ritual Reset</span>
          <h3>3. Customize your phone to support your ritual</h3>
          <p>We'll apply intentional design changes to reduce noise and support your new rhythm. Depending on your goals, I'll guide you through:</p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Focus Modes that shift with your time, place, or energy</li>
            <li>Home screen layouts that center what matters and hide what doesn't</li>
            <li>Automations to create seamless starts, stops, or transitions</li>
            <li>Shortcuts for routines, boundaries, or intention resets</li>
            <li>Widgets that gently guide your attention where you want it</li>
            <li>Quiet cues like filtered notifications and hidden apps to protect your space</li>
          </ul>
