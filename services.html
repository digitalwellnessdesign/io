      <h2>What if your phone supported the habits you want to keep?</h2>
      <p>Not the distractions you're trying to leave behind.</p>
      <p>I work one-to-one with people who want their iPhone to reflect their values and support their wellness practices. Less noise, more intention. Rhythms that feel sustainable, not forced.</p>

      <h3>What we'll explore together</h3>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>What you want more of in your days and what patterns you're ready to shift</li>
        <li>A wellness ritual or daily rhythm that fits your real life, not someone else's ideal</li>
        <li>Thoughtful iPhone design changes that reduce friction and support what matters</li>

      <p>This isn't a sales pitch. It's an exploratory conversation to help you get clear on what you want and how I might support that.</p>

      <h3>In our call, we'll talk about:</h3>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>What you want more of in your daily life and what's getting in the way</li>
        <li>The habits or routines you'd like to strengthen or introduce</li>
        <li>How your current phone setup helps or hinders your goals</li>
        <li>Whether the full Ritual Reset session feels like the right next step</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There's no pressure to commit. This is about clarity before any decision.</p>

      <h2>If we decide to work together: The Ritual Reset</h2>
      <p>After our free call, if the Ritual Reset feels like a fit, here's what happens.</p>

      <div class="process-steps">
        <div class="process-step">
          <h3>1. Clarify your current priority</h3>
          <p>We'll identify what matters most to you right now and use that focus to shape your ritual. Your priority might be:</p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Physical wellness</li>
            <li>Mental and emotional balance</li>
            <li>Productivity and focus</li>
            <li>Financial grounding</li>
            <li>Reflection and spiritual practice</li>
            <li>Relationships and connection</li>
            <li>Creativity and joy</li>
            <li>Home environment or travel rhythms</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <h3>2. Co-design your custom wellness ritual</h3>
          <p>Together we'll shape a habit or routine that fits your real life and moves you forward. This might look like:</p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>A no-scroll morning grounding to start your day without spiraling</li>
            <li>A wind-down that actually helps your nervous system rest</li>
            <li>A weekly check-in for groceries, finances, or planning</li>
            <li>Protected creative blocks for writing, art, or flow work</li>
            <li>Gentle movement nudges that fit your actual energy</li>
            <li>Meal and hydration anchors so essentials don't get skipped</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <h3>3. Customize your phone to support your ritual</h3>
          <p>We'll apply intentional design changes to reduce noise and support your new rhythm. Depending on your goals, I'll guide you through:</p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Focus Modes that shift with your time, place, or energy</li>
            <li>Home screen layouts that center what matters and hide what doesn't</li>
            <li>Automations to create seamless starts, stops, or transitions</li>
            <li>Shortcuts for routines, boundaries, or intention resets</li>
            <li>Widgets that gently guide your attention where you want it</li>
            <li>Quiet cues like filtered notifications and hidden apps to protect your space</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <h2>If wellness habits slip but scrolling doesn't</h2>
      <p>You're not alone and you're not doing it wrong. This work is about rebuilding your rhythm without shame or overwhelm.</p>
      <p>You're not the only one who:</p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Tries setting app limits or deleting distractions, only to drift back</li>
        <li>Loves wellness practices but they get lost in the day-to-day</li>
        <li>Thrives on variety, which makes routine feel slippery or rigid</li>
        <li>Feels torn about screen time—you rely on it and wish it felt more intentional</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The average smartphone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day.</p>
      <p>That's 150+ chances to feel scattered or supported. What if your phone became a tool for grounding, not just grabbing and going?</p>
