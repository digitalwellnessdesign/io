      <h2>What if your phone supported that wellness habit or routine?</h2>
      <p>Yes, instead of distracting you from the life you want to be living.</p>
      <p>Let's customize your iPhone (and go beyond Screen Time Limits) to power up what you want to prioritize.</p>

      <h3>Trade distractions for what you want more of</h3>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Clarity on what actually matters in your days this season</li>
        <li>A wellness ritual that fits — and expands — your real life</li>
        <li>iPhone design changes that reduce noise and reinforce your ritual</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we make your phone work for YOU</h2>
      <p>This is one part mindset work, two parts meaningful tech tweaks.</p>

      <div class="process-steps">
        <div class="process-step">
          <h3>1. Clarify your current priority and why</h3>
          <p>We'll use this focus to shape your ritual and align your phone to support it. We can work on any priority you have:</p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Physical</li>
            <li>Mental & Emotional</li>
            <li>Productivity & Focus</li>
            <li>Financial</li>
            <li>Reflective & Spiritual</li>
            <li>Relationships & Connection</li>
            <li>Creativity & Joy</li>
            <li>Home, Environment & Travel</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <h3>2. Co-design your custom wellness ritual</h3>
          <p>Together we'll shape a habit or routine that fits your real life and moves you forward.</p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>No-scroll morning grounding – start your day without spiraling into feeds</li>
            <li>Wind-down that works – a cue that helps your nervous system actually rest</li>
            <li>Weekly check-in – for groceries, finances or other planning</li>
            <li>Protected creative blocks – focused time for writing, art or flow work</li>
            <li>Gentle movement nudges – that fit your real energy (not forced)</li>
            <li>Meal + hydration anchors – so essentials don't get skipped</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <h3>3. Customize your phone to support your ritual</h3>
          <p>We'll apply intentional design changes to reduce noise and support your new rhythm. Depending on your goals, I'll guide you through some combination of these options:</p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Focus Modes that shift with your time, place, or energy</li>
            <li>Home screen layouts that center what matters (and hide what doesn't)</li>
            <li>Automations to create seamless starts, stops, or transitions</li>
            <li>Shortcuts for routines, boundaries, or intention resets</li>
            <li>Widgets that gently guide your attention where you want it</li>
            <li>Quiet cues like filtered notifications and hidden apps to protect your space</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <h2>If you tend to let your wellness habit slip but not your scroll</h2>
      <p>You're not alone and you're not doing it wrong. This session is about rebuilding your rhythm, without shame or overwhelm.</p>
      <p>You're not the only one who...</p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Tries setting app limits or deleting distractions, only to drift back</li>
        <li>Loves your wellness practices, but they often get lost in the day-to-day</li>
        <li>Thrives on variety, which makes routine feel slippery or rigid</li>
        <li>Feels torn about your screen time, you rely on it and wish it felt more intentional</li>
