  <!-- Positioning Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="container content-section">
      <h2>What if your phone reflected who you're becoming?</h2>
      <p>Not just who you've been. Not just what you "should" be doing. But who you are in this moment — and where you're headed next.</p>
      <p>This is not about productivity. This is spacious alignment for your next chapter.</p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Clear digital clutter that no longer fits your season</li>
        <li>Clarify what matters now and let go of what doesn't</li>
        <li>Reorganize your phone setup so it supports your energy, priorities, and growth</li>

  <!-- What's Included Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="container content-section">
      <h3>What's included</h3>

      <div class="feature-block">
        <h3>Seasonal Reflection</h3>
        <p>We begin by reflecting on where you are in both the outer season and your own inner cycle. This helps set the tone for the redesign by clarifying what matters now, what you're growing toward, and how your tech can support that shift.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: var(--space-2);"><em>Optional astrology bonus: if you provide your birthdate, time and place, I'll share insights from vedic astrology focused on timing.</em></p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-block">
        <h3>Daily Rhythm Mapping</h3>
        <p>We'll use a Notion tool, the Daily Rhythm Mapper, so your intentions and redesign are rooted in your actual day-to-day. This tool helps us see your natural energy patterns plus your focus windows and transition points. It helps reveal where in your day to add digital support for your goals.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-block">
        <h3>Full iPhone Redesign</h3>
        <p>We'll co-create a custom, supportive digital environment across:</p>
        <ul class="bullet-list" style="margin-top: var(--space-2);">
          <li>Home Screen(s)</li>
          <li>Background and colors</li>
          <li>Today View (widgets on furthest swipe to the left)</li>
          <li>Lock Screen</li>
          <li>Focus Modes</li>
          <li>Screen Limits</li>
          <li>Automations + reminders</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: var(--space-2);">All tailored to your nervous system, your goals, and your current capacity.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-block">
        <h3>Visual Redesign Mockups + Implementation Time</h3>
        <p>We'll walkthrough how to make changes to your iPhone step by step so you'll leave the call with newly redesigned screens. You'll also receive a visual example showing your redesigned screens as a reference. Plus, it includes instructions to set up any focus modes, limits and automations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-block">
        <h3>Post-Session Recap + Recording</h3>
        <p>You'll receive all your designs, notes, and a video recording to revisit so your new setup can unfold at your pace.</p>

    <div class="container content-section">
      <h3>This is for you if</h3>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>you're wanting to make a few changes in your life or are already in a major transition</li>
        <li>harmony sounds better to you than hustle</li>
        <li>you phone does not feel aligned with your values and wellness goals</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Format Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="container content-section">
      <h3>One-or-two-session experience</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, you need more time, space and support to make changes. We all need space. To breathe. To untangle. To reconnect with your vision and your nervous system before moving into action.</p>
      <p>We begin with deep listening to your nervous system, your goals and favorite feel-good rituals, and your current daily rhythm. Together, we'll map a phone and system that supports how you actually want to live.</p>
      <p>You get to decide whether we listen, redesign and implement all in one 2.5-hour session or break it up into a 60-minute one day and a 90-minute session on another day.</p>
