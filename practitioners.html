      <h1>For Wellness Practitioners</h1>
      <p>Help your clients make lifestyle changes stick with technology that supports their wellness plans.</p>

  <!-- Problem Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="container content-section">
      <h2>You know what your clients need. Digital wellness helps them actually do it.</h2>
      <p>As a wellness practitioner, you guide your clients toward healthier habits — better sleep, consistent movement, stress reduction, mindful eating, or daily rituals that support their goals.</p>
      <p>But here's the challenge: they reach for their phone 150+ times a day, and often that same device becomes the biggest barrier to following through.</p>
      <p>That's where digital wellness design comes in.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- How It Works Section -->
  <section style="background-color: var(--color-sunlight);">
    <div class="container content-section">
      <h2>A complementary service for your practice</h2>
      <p>Digital wellness design isn't a replacement for your work — it's a supportive layer that helps your recommendations land and stick.</p>

      <div class="process-step">
        <h3>For nutritionists and health coaches</h3>
        <p>Your client wants to meal prep on Sundays, drink more water, or avoid late-night snacking. Their iPhone can send gentle reminders, block distracting apps during meal times, and create focus modes that support their eating windows.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step">
        <h3>For therapists and mental health practitioners</h3>
        <p>Your client is working on setting boundaries, grounding practices, or reducing anxious scrolling. Their phone can be redesigned to support morning journaling routines, limit social media access during vulnerable hours, and automate calming transitions between work and rest.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step">
        <h3>For yoga teachers and movement specialists</h3>
        <p>Your client wants to stretch daily, take walking breaks, or create a consistent practice. Their iPhone can prompt movement at natural energy dips, hide distractions during practice time, and make it easier to choose grounding over scrolling.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step">
        <h3>For sleep coaches and nervous system specialists</h3>
        <p>Your client needs to wind down earlier, reduce blue light exposure, and create evening rituals. Their phone can automate red light filters at sunset, silence notifications after a certain hour, and offer gentle cues that support rest instead of stimulation.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <!-- Benefits Section -->
  <section>
    <div class="container content-section">
      <h2>Why refer clients to digital wellness design?</h2>
